# M-ORTGAGE-A-PPROVALS-B-USINESS-D-ATA-
This code using Random forest and Artificial Neural Network to solve the problem of loan in the bank.
The mean objective was to apply machine learning technique to predict whether a mortgage application was accepted or denied.
• Removed the missing values.
• Used correlation matrix and mutual information to do the feature selection.
• Used the classification algorithm (Random forest) and artificial neural network (ANN) to predict whether a mortgage application was accepted or denied according to the given dataset.
• Used Confusion matrix and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) to evaluated the models.
